Subject	: Device Tree Overlays

We were asked to configure P9_42to be in input pin, with a pullÂ­up resistor by using a device tree overlay.
Since we had only one Beaglebone, we shared the Beaglebone for this part of the homework.

The following steps were followed:

1) These commands were executed:

bone$ export SLOTS=/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.*/slots
bone$ export PINS=/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins
bone$ export PINMUX=/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pinmux-pins
bone$ export PINGROUPS=/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pingroups

2) Then we executed this to see which pins were unclaimed:

grep "(MUX UNCLAIMED) (GPIO UNCLAIMED)" $PINMUX

3) We saw the free pins with their pin numbers by executing this:

bone$ cd exercises/gpio
bone$ ./freeGPIO

4) We found information about P9_42 by running this:

bone$ ./findGPIO.js P9_16
