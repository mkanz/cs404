Subject	: Project report on lab02


	Lab 02 was about blining LEDs with different inputs, orders and sequences.We also learned to get inputs from push buttons.And later combined the buttons and LEDs together . Controlling the LEDs with differrent input variations.
blink_LED.js	-A simple program to blink an LED.
push_button.js	-Program to control 4 LEDs using 4 buttons
LED_var1.js	-The top LED turns on with either switch is pressed.Both LEDs light when both switches are pressed.
LED_var2.js	-Pressing one switch blinks an LED 10 times and then stops.
LED_var3.js	-Pressing one switch starts an LED blinking.Pressing another switch stops the LED .

Lab 2 was interesting and fun.
