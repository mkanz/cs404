Prof. Yoder comments
Very nice memo. The code you present looks good.
Where's the code for the web part?

Subject	: Project report on lab03

  Lab03 was about using analog devices with the bone. First we used potentiometers to read analog voltage. Code for this is contained in "Analog_read.js". We learnt the pins for analog I/O.
  
  Next we controlled the brigthness of LEDs using the in-built PWM on the bone. We also faded the LEDs on and off alternately. Code for these are in "fade2.js" and "fade2_alternate.js".
  
  Then we controlled the brightness of the LEDs using the potentiometer. This is contained in "LED_potentiometer.js".
  
  We also read values from the potentiometer and a button on the bone to a web page. We then controlled an LED onthe bone via a webpage. We learnt to interface the bone with the web using both jsfiddle and cloud9 IDE on the bone, and about using analog I/O devices with the bone.
