Comments from Mark A. Yoder
I see you have the LED matrix lighting up.  I was even able to get your "K" to appear
after modifying your code.
I was hoping for some other interesting things. 
The assignment asked for the display to respond to a button press.
No Etch-a-sketch.

  Lab 4 was quite different. We worked with an LED matrix, which can be plugged to the bone.
  
  At first we drew different faces like smiling face, frowning face and a neutral face on the LED matrix. The code for this is in "LEDmatrix_faces.js".
  Later, we wrote the letter 'K' on the LEDmatrix .The code is in the file "LEDmatrix_K.js"
  
 LED matrices can be used for displaying signs or symbols and even to display text messages. We aim to iincorporate our etch-a-sketch program to the LEDmatrix, in the coming lab sessions.
