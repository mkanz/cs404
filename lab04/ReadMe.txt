Subject	: Project report on lab04

  Lab 4 was quite different. We worked with an LED matrix, which can be plugged to the bone.
  
  At first we drew different faces like smiling face, frowning face and a neutral face on the LED matrix. The code for this is in "LEDmatrix_faces.js".
  Later, we wrote the letter 'K' on the LEDmatrix .The code is in the file "LEDmatrix_K.js"
  
 LED matrices can be used for displaying signs or symbols and even to display text messages. We aim to iincorporate our etch-a-sketch program to the LEDmatrix, in the coming lab sessions.
