  Lab 5 was an interesting ecxercise.We worked with Range finders and proximity sensors.
  
  At first we found object distances using  an ultraosnic range sensor .The code for this function in in the file "Rangefinder.js".
  Later, we controlled the brightness of two leds with the range finder.The brightness of leds increased as the object came closer.The code is in the file "fade_range.js"
  
  Proximity sensor was also used to find the distance of objects.The code for this function is the file "proximity.js".
  
  Range finders have numerous applications , for example in autonomous cars, parking sensors etc. We can aslo use them in wheel chairs for the blind and disabled.Proximity sensors are commonly seen in moblies phones etc.
