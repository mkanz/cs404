Subject	: Project report on lab06

  Lab06 was about using analog devices with the bone. First we interfaced a joystick to the bone. Code for this is in "joy.js"
  
  Next we controlled the position of a point on the LED matrix using joystick. Code for this is in "joy_pointer.js". A variation of this is to print messages "hi" and "K" when the joystick is at each end. Code for this is in: "joy_hi_K.js"
  
  Then we controlled the brightness of the LEDs using the joystick. This is contained in "joy_brightness.js".
