Subject	: Project report on lab07

  Lab 7 was an interesting ecxercise.We worked with Gyroscopes, accelerometers and thermometers.
  
  At first we got values from the various sensors.The code used for interfacing is in the file "gyro_acc_temp.js"
  
  Then we mapped the thermometer reading to a webpage "webpage_bone.html".The code for this function is the file "webpage_temp.js".

  Then we gave readings of both the thermometer and the accelerometer to a webpage "webpage_bone.html" .The source code for this function is the file "webpage_all.js".
  
  Accelerometers and gyroscopes are used in numerous places like mobile phones, and other embedded systems.
  
  Fritzing file is in "Lab07.fzz".
